# Decision Trees and Regression Trees / Loan-Repayment-Estimate
Introduction to Decision Tree Method and its Applications on Credit Debt Data
## Overview
Decision trees are supervised machine learning models that hierarchically classify or perform regression by splitting data based on attributes with the highest information gain. The theoretical framework of these models relies on understandable calculations such as entropy and information gain. Their internal operations and decision-making processes are easy to understand. 

Due to their ability to handle both classification and regression problems and compatibility with both numerical and categorical data, decision trees are widely used. They can be employed independently or as foundational elements in ensemble methods. Additionally, because attribute selection is performed algorithmically, decision trees can also be used for feature selection in other machine learning models. However, they are prone to overfitting, exhibit high sensitivity, and are limited by axis-aligned splits.

## Project Details
This project explores the fundamental principles, historical development, and algorithmic structure of decision trees and regression trees. It details how decision trees operate on categorical and numerical data, explaining metrics such as information gain and the Gini index for feature selection.

### Practical Application
For practical demonstration, a credit dataset was used to train two models:
1. **Debt Payment Prediction (Classification)**.
2. **Credit Amount Prediction (Regression)**.

The performance of the trained models was compared and evaluated.

## Summary
This study combines theoretical foundations and practical applications to comprehensively address the strengths and limitations of tree-based models in machine learning.
